The new study published today is the first to compare how people with Covid-19 smell and taste disorders differ from those with other causes of upper respiratory tract infections. The main differences found are that, although Covid-19 patients also lose their sense of smell, they can breathe freely, do not tend to have a runny or blocked nose, and they cannot detect bitter or sweet tastes.",

Now, a new study may explain why — the disease appears to spur the production of special antibodies known to trigger blot clots. These so-called \"autoimmune antibodies\" or \"autoantibodies\" attack a person's own tissues. Specific types of autoantibodies called \"antiphospholipid autoantibodies\" attack cells in such a way as to promote blood clots.  In the study, published Nov. 2 in the journal Science Translational Medicine, researchers detected these autoantibodies in about half of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.",

This may explain why COVID-19 pneumonia lasts longer and causes more harm than typical pneumonia, according to the researchers at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. The research team said that their aim is to make COVID-19 more like a bad cold. For the study, the team analyzed immune cells from the lungs of COVID-19 pneumonia patients and compared them to cells from patients with pneumonia caused by other viruses or bacteria.",

Researchers examined more than 87,000 COVID-19 patients and nearly 5 million control patients in a federal database. They found COVID-19 patients had a 59% higher risk of death up to 6 months after infection, compared to non-infected people. Those findings translate into about eight extra deaths per 1,000 patients over 6 months, because many deaths caused by long-term COVID complications are not recorded as COVID-19 deaths, the researchers said.",

The seven-day average for COVID-19 cases is as high as it's been statewide since February, while the percent-positive of tests is at 6.",

Data from three Western states subject to frequent wildfires shows that COVID-19 cases and deaths increase with the amount of smoke pollution in the air, according to a new study. As wildfires raged last year, a daily increase in fine particle pollution of just 10 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) of air was associated with an average 12% increase in COVID-19 cases and an 8% increase in COVID-related deaths over the course of a month, said lead researcher Xiaodan Zhou.",
